# Description
This project is an messy, unstructured exploration of data relating to the Boston Housing Market

# Goals and Principles
The project is going to require many little decisions which will add up to the (currently) unknowable outcome. Both top down, goal-oriented thinking and bottom-up, principle-oriented thinking must drive these decisions. Both are wishy-washy and meaningless without an explicit decision of what laudable goals/principles are being de-prioritized to allow sufficient focus. Here are my goals for the project, in priority order:
## Goals
1. Learning to _do data journalism_ with data _combined_ from public sources
    1. __Not__ to do advanced analysis or reveal groundbreaking truths
1. Catalog what _quality_ data is available about Boston and Real Estate
    1. __Not__ to do heavy lifting on poorly formatted data
1. Get a deeper insight into the process of living in Boston itself
    1. __Not__ to comment on national trends
 
## Principles
1. At an architectural level, don't worry about generalizing if that's the only way you can make progress initially
    1. There is a lot of value in thinking ahead about scalability and consistency for big projects, but this is __not__ a big project, nor are any functions designed to be dependencies for other projects
1. The files will conform to [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) standards
    1. I will __Not__ prioritize additional analysis in place of cleanup
    1. This prioritization of _solid_ analysis is orthogonal to anti-Goal 1.1, de-prioritizes _complex_ analysis
    1. This prioritization of _local_ best practices is an exception to the de-prioritization of _architectural_ best practices in Principle 1
